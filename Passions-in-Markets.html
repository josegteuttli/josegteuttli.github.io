<p>The last passion that I picked up unexpectedly was a passion in economics, and more specifically in markets. I became very interested in stock markets and from there other types of markets that are now available today such as options and other securities. Through this passion I ended up reading a lot about the 2008 market crash and Greeceâ€™s debt problem than I ever thought I would. While I do not expect to make a career out of this passion, it is definitely something I will continue to develop into the future.</p>
