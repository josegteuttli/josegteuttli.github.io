<p>It was during FTC 2013-2014 that I realized that I eventually wanted to go into computer science, I didn’t further decide about going into artificial intelligence until later, but the seeds had been planted. During FTC 2013-2014 I assisted Nathan in programming the team robot in LabVIEW, a visual programming language, while working with Nathan I sincerely enjoyed my time. I found that programming was something I enjoyed doing, the slow process of starting with nothing and over time building it up and fixing bugs as they appear was really appealing to me. The following year I got a taste of my first text-based language, perhaps the simplest of all those out there, Python. Using python at home I began to automate certain tasks that before I did myself, such as opening programs, macros, or keeping track of scores and records for the games I played. During my sophomore year programming went from something I enjoyed doing in school to something I enjoyed doing at home as a hobby. I kept learning python during my Sophomore and Junior year. Now during my Senior year, while in AP Comp Sci with Mr. Adams I have focused on learning java. It wasn’t until Senior year that I really developed a love for artificial intelligence, and started religiously following the news regarding it. This is how I came to find out about Elon Musk and his startups as well as others such as DeepMind who work for google. I am working towards getting a degree in computer science with the end goal of working in the industry of artificial intelligence.</p>
